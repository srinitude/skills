# Fresh direct turn

## Intent

Answer a non-date request while proving that the skill still refreshes the clock and binds `as_of` before composition.

## Input

```text
Give me three names for a small research project.
```

## Command

Run with the skill directory as the process working directory.

```bash
mise run refresh --timezone UTC
```

## Real output

```json
{
  "captured_at": "2026-07-30T21:16:35+00:00",
  "date": "2026-07-30",
  "source": "argument",
  "time": "21:16:35",
  "timezone": "UTC",
  "tomorrow": "2026-07-31",
  "utc_offset": "+00:00",
  "weekday": "Thursday",
  "yesterday": "2026-07-29",
  "zone_abbreviation": "UTC"
}
```

Exit code: `0`.

## Private binding

```text
as_of: 2026-07-30T21:16:35+00:00, 2026-07-30, 21:16:35, Thursday, UTC, UTC, +00:00, argument
```

## User-facing response

```text
NOW: Thursday, July 30, 2026 at 21:16:35 | UTC | UTC+00:00
[2026-07-30 21:16:35 UTC] Three names: Small Signal Lab, Field Note Works, and Quiet Evidence.
```

Created files: none.

Verification: the clock ran before interpretation despite the absence of date or time words, the reply preserved the request, and the actual response stored both required date-time prefixes.
